# Fateseal

This is a simple utility website that takes an MTG decklist and exports a Tabletop Simulator compatible JSON file. That's it!

## Running locally

This website will eventually be hosted, but for now it can be run locally. All that is necessary is cloning the repository and running the following commands:

```shell

$ npm install
$ npm run dev

```

Then you just need to navigate to `localhost:3000` and the app is available to use.
